## Why WebCodecs Fundamentals?

Current WebCodecs documentation is fragmented between abstract W3C specs and outdated blog posts. **This is the Production Manual** that covers real-world challenges like memory management, ring buffers, and AV sync.

  <Card title="Core Concepts" icon="pencil">
    Understand CPU vs GPU memory, threading models, and file handling patterns.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design Patterns" icon="add-document">
    Production-tested patterns for playback, transcoding, and live streaming.
  </Card>
  <Card title="High Performance" icon="rocket">
    Zero-copy rendering, explicit memory management, and compute optimization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Troubleshooting" icon="warning">
    Debug buffer stalls, encoder timeouts, and codec compatibility issues.

## Who is this for?

- **Browser Engineers & Standards Bodies** looking for quality resources to reference
- **Senior Frontend Engineers** building video editors, transcoders, or AI tools
- **The WebCodecs Ecosystem** - partners who need a central knowledge hub
