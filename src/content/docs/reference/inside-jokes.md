This site contains a few recurring inside jokes and references which are also found in programmer / internet pop culture. Here is what they mean:

## Citation Needed

[Randall Munroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe) is the author of a popular web comic called [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) which includes particularly nerdy humour.

One recurring joke from xkcd is the citation needed meme, which originally appeared in the following comic strip on July 4th, 2007.

The original comic itself conveyed a different joke, highlighting that adding `citation needed` note constitutes a passive-aggressive way of calling out someone for an unsubstantiated claim.

Later, in Randall munroe's ["what if"](https://what-if.xkcd.com/) blog as well as the [related books](https://xkcd.com/books/) he's written, he often includes [citation needed] under a different context:

Where he adds [citation needed] next to an obvious fact, as if it required some authoratative source or original research to back up the claim.

The meme adds irreverent humor when discussing topics that might otherwise actually require references, like this website or like Randall Munroe's other blog posts and book articles, which often are full of real world legitimate citations.
